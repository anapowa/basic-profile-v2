Assessment: More HTML Tags
Remember the assessment: 'Basic Portfolio' where we created a web page demonstrating headers, paragraphs, and anchor tags ( <h1>, <p>, and <a href="...">)?

It looked something like this: https://ka-basic-profile.glitch.me/

Well today we want you to add more content to that page, making use of all the new markup you have learned. Additionally, you will be moving this code into a GitLab repository so that you can deploy it via GitLab pages for submission.

Please use the following features:

Ordered and unordered lists
Bold and italic text
Summary and details tags
Separating content using divisions (divs), sections, and horizontal rules
Configuring the title of the page or tab
Embedding images
Showing one or more special characters using HTML Entities
All of the items above are required, but feel free to use other tags or introduce rudimentary styling if you like!
